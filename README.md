# COFFEE-SALES-DASHBOARD

I started the data manipulation process using Excel formulas such as XLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH to efficiently organize and prepare the data for visualization. These formulas allowed me to accurately retrieve and match data across different tables, ensuring that the final Power BI dashboard provides clear and actionable insights into coffee sales trends, customer preferences, and sales distribution across different regions and product variations.

Here are some questions that can be answered by the visualizations on your coffee sales dashboard:

1. **What is the trend of total coffee sales over time?**
   

2. **Which coffee type has the highest preference among customers?**
  

3. **How do different roast types correlate with sales trends?**
   

4. **What is the sales distribution by coffee size?**
   

5. **Which countries contribute the most to coffee sales?**
  

6. **How do sales of different coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta) vary over time?**
  
7. **How does the order date range impact sales patterns?**
 
Based on the coffee sales dashboard, here are some recommendations:

  Focus on Popular Coffee Types:
        Excelsa and Liberica are the most preferred coffee types, as shown in the pie chart. It would be beneficial to focus marketing efforts on these varieties, perhaps by promoting them more prominently or introducing new products featuring these coffee types.

  Investigate Seasonal Sales Trends:
        The line chart shows fluctuations in coffee sales over time, with noticeable peaks in certain months. Understanding the reasons behind these peaks, such as seasonal demand or marketing campaigns, can help in planning future promotions or inventory management.

  Optimize Product Sizes:
        Analyzing the sales distribution by size can reveal which sizes are most popular. If a particular size consistently underperforms, consider reducing its production or offering special deals to clear stock.

  Target High-Performing Regions:
        The "Sales By Country" chart shows that the United States leads in sales, followed by the United Kingdom and Ireland. You might consider increasing targeted marketing in these high-performing regions to further boost sales.

  Improve Low-Selling Coffee Types:
        Since Robusta is the least preferred coffee type, consider conducting customer surveys to understand why itâ€™s less popular. Depending on the findings, you could either improve its quality or reconsider its place in the product lineup.

  Refine the Product Mix:
        The data can help in making decisions about which roast types and sizes to focus on or potentially phase out. For instance, if "Medium" roast consistently shows lower sales, it may be worth exploring why and adjusting the product mix accordingly.
